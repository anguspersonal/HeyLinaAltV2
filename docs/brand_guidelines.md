# Brand Guidelines - HeyLina

## 1. Brand Identity

### Mission
To empower people to understand, express, and heal their emotions through intelligent, accessible, and compassionate tools that make emotional wellbeing part of everyday life.

### Vision
A world where no one has to feel alone when processing tough emotional decisions. Where emotional awareness is as natural as physical health. Where everyone feels safe to feel, analyze, and grow. We aim to bridge science and empathy, helping individuals turn self-awareness into real healing through intelligent technology, thoughtful design, and genuine human connection.

### About Hey Lina
Lina is more than a chatbot; it's a trusted emotional companion that listens, reflects, and guides. We believe that understanding your emotions shouldn't feel clinical or distant. It should feel human, intuitive, and kind. We speak as a friend who understands, a guide who explains, and a scientist who knows. We blend psychological insight, data intelligence, and design empathy to help people decode what they feel.

### Tone of Voice
We speak with warmth, clarity, and confidence. Our voice feels like a trusted friend—intelligent but never intimidating, empathetic but never overly sentimental. We use simple human language, never buzzwords. We guide gently with knowledge and calm assurance. We acknowledge feelings without dramatizing them. We speak to everyone with care and sensitivity.
